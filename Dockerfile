# Note: this Dockerfile uses a multistage build to prevent the final image from being unnecessarily large. During a build, each RUN command
# creates a new layer that persists into the final image, even if packages installed early on are later uninstalled before 
# the end of the Dockerfile. To avoid this, most of the installation takes place during stage one, then only the github-pages gem is
# copied over into stage 2.

# The FROM command specifies a base image to start with. We're using an Alpine Linux base because it's small (around 5MB), together with a Ruby installation 
# that matches GitHub Pages' current Ruby version (2.7.3-alpine3.13 as of 08/03/2022, ruby:2.7.4-alpine3.14 as of 8/18/2022)
